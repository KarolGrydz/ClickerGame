#Clicker game in ReactJS

This is a simply clicker game write in javascript and reactjs library. The main goal is to click as much as you can in ten seconds. The packages I use in this app are:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for storage players result,
- [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to make simply tests,
- [Styled-Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) to make so basic components,
- for input and buttons I used [Bootstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) for React
